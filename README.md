# Molecular Probe Combination Guide (Hybrid Solvent Inserter)
Molecular probes are essential tools for uncovering cryptic pockets and potential binding hotspots in protein structures. This article systematically summarizes the properties, suitable environments, and recommended combinations of 13 commonly used probes in Mixed solvent molecular dynamics (MixMD) simulations. Detailed usage notes are provided for each individual probe, offering practical guidance for selecting and combining probes based on pocket polarity, hydrophobicity, aromaticity, and charge characteristics. This comprehensive guide aims to help researchers design more effective probe sets for structure-based drug discovery and molecular recognition studies.

**MixMD System Builder** is a web-based application for generating mixed-solvent molecular simulation systems. It supports protein structure upload, flexible probe selection, box configuration, and automatic topology generation. Users can easily integrate custom molecules and apply optional solvation and ionization, resulting in ready-to-use simulation packages. I redeployed this online tool in my repository and you can use this tool for free by clicking <a href="https://skvohekthzsp.ap-southeast-1.clawcloudrun.com">here</a>.

**Probe GridMap Builder** is a local web-based software interface designed to analyze molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories in .trr or .nc format, powered by the AMBER cpptraj backend. It enables users to generate grid-based interaction maps between protein structures and solvent probe atoms across dynamic frames.
