# Molecular Probes Guide (Hybrid Solvent Inserter)

In mixed-solvent molecular dynamics (MixMD) simulations, a rational combination of different molecular probes greatly enhances the detection of cryptic pockets and potential binding hotspots in biomolecules. This guide summarizes the properties, classifications.

**MixMD System Builder** is a web-based application for generating mixed-solvent molecular simulation systems. It supports protein structure upload, flexible probe selection, box configuration, and automatic topology generation. Users can easily integrate custom molecules and apply optional solvation and ionization, resulting in ready-to-use simulation packages. I redeployed this online tool in my repository and you can use this tool for free by clicking <a href="https://skvohekthzsp.ap-southeast-1.clawcloudrun.com">here</a>.

**Probe GridMap Builder** is a lightweight web interface designed for analyzing MD trajectories (in .trr or .nc formats) using AMBERâ€™s cpptraj backend. It enables users to generate grid-based interaction maps between protein structures and solvent probe atoms across dynamic frames. You can use this tool for free by clicking <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14x89Ehda61HUxoY_bQcPqJhTKsd0Zd6R/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. ðŸ”¬ Live Demo ðŸ‘‰ [the demo interface](https://sean28.github.io/MixMD/probe_gridmap_ui.html)

# Principles of Usage Instructions for Single probe

## Common Probe Information

This table summarizes the molecular weight and density information of 13 commonly used molecular probes.

| Probe | Molecular Weight (g/mol) | Density (g/mL) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| formamide | 45.041 | 1.13 |
| dmso | 78.129 | 1.10 | 
| meoh (methanol) | 32.042 | 0.791 |

### Notes
- **Guanidinium**:  
  Pure guanidinium cation density is unavailable; estimated based on typical guanidinium chloride solution density (~1.26 g/mL). Can detect negatively charged regions on protein surfaces (such as near Asp and Glu residues)

- **Acetate**:  
  As pure acetate ion density is not measurable directly, acetic acid (CHâ‚ƒCOOH) liquid density (~1.0492 g/mL) is used as an approximation. Can detect positively charged regions on protein surfaces (such as near LyS and Arg residues)

---

### Special Notes
---

1. Electric neutral system: If many charged small molecules are added, additional Na * and CI ions must be added in the simulation to balance the overall charge
2. Short range exclusion: A small amount of random dispersion can be added to the initial distribution of probes to prevent excessive stacking
3. Minimize energy: After adding the probe, it is very important to perform a rigorous round of restrained minimization!
